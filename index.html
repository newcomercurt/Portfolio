        <p>
          I am a bit of a nerd. I tend to pursue passions that tickle my fancy and occasionally stumble across something I really love or I am good at. Some of which include playing multiple instruments, making hiking sticks for my friends, fishing, gardening,
          cooking, and I also collect coins (I am well aware of how dorky this last one is). Anyhow, my newest endeavor is learning how to code and I love it. I have taken a chance on myself to build up my skills to advance my career path and so far it's
          been a pretty fruitful adventure.
          <br>
          <br> Before pursuing this path I am taking I was a Marketing Specialist/Professional Develepment Specialist for RE/MAX equity group. It's a hokey title but essentially when I started my first responsibility was to manage our weekly advertising campaign
          with the Oregonian Media Group. I ended up taking on way more responsibilty which was great. I provided one on one training and support for our salesforce of 600+ brokers, staff, and management on our proprietary technology and other third party
          services. I helped evaluate vendors and software and make recommendations based on our budget and marketing objectives.
          <br>
          <br> I was also part of a team that on-boarded our entire company with an enterprise applications. Some of which improved company communication, created synergy with our multiple branches, and assisted in our attempt to create brand & company buy
          in.
          <br>
          <br> I also managed our partnership with the Portland Trail Blazers which we utilized for recruiting, retention, brand awareness, and to support our in house mortgage company.
          <br>
          <br> One of my colleagues and I were also responsible for planning all company events. Between the two us we planned manager meetings, recognition recepions, and company wide parties.
          <br>
          <br> In addition to the above, I was cross trained with our IT department to assist our staff and clients as needed in deployment of new hardware, software, and onboarding of new associates.
          <br>
          <br> I am a curious person so I am always looking into learning something new or figuring out the why or what of things. Right now, I am starting a project with some friends where we will play geek rock covers of 80’s songs. So think Oh Sheila performed
          in the style of Weezer; we’re still figuring this out.
